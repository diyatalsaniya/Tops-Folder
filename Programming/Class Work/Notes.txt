-> Application Security:

- Application security refers to security precautions used at the application to prevent the theft or hijacking of data or code within the application.
- It includes security concerns made during application development and design, as well as methods and procedures for protecting applications once they've been deployed.

Value, Variable, Datatypes
- a = 10
- 10 is value
- a is variable


Datatypes:

int		%d		12345
float		%f		12.485
string		%s		tcjhbkj
char		%c		a,i,t
double		%lf		864513251351468454
long double 	%Lf		4684531.8453143521



-> Loop: It repeats till condition is satisfied it work


2 Types:
1) Entry 
	1. While Loop , 
	2. For Loop
2) Exit 
	3. Do while


3 Steps:
	1. Start
	2. Stop
	3. Increment


-> Control Statements:

3 Types:

- 1. break
- 2. continue
- 3. goto



-> Functions(Methods): Function is a block of code that we can use it again & again.

2 types of function :
1. built in functions -> printf, scanf
2. user defined function -> there are 4 types of it - 1. Function without parameters and without return type
						      2. Function with parameters and without return type
						      3. Function without parameters and with return type
						      4. Function with parameters and with return type

There are 3 steps for function : 1. Function Declare (Which is not important)
				 2. Function Definition 
				 3. Function Calling (Execute)
