->> Class: Collection of data members and member functions.

Class Properties: data members and functions

Class Keyword : Class and then name of class 


***************************************************************


->> Object: Object is instance of class through the object we can access all the properties of function.

- Access Specifiers:

3 types:
1. Public -> accessible to all
2. Private
3. Protected 

***************************************************************


->> Constructor: 
- same name as class name
- automatically call itself when object is created.
- Constructor is Called in starting of website.

> 3 types:
1. Default 
2. Parameterized 
3. Copy


***********************************************************


->> Destructor:
- same name as class name
- automatically call itself when object is created.
- Destructor is Called in ending of website.


***********************************************************

->> Inheritance: When one class derived the properties into another class it is called inheritance.

> 5 Types:
1. Single level
2. Multi level
3. Multiple level
4. Hierarchi
5. Hybrid


1. Single level:

	A (PARENT, ROOT, BASE CLASS)
	|
	B (CHILD, DERIVED, SUB CLASS)
